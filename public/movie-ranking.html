<h1>The Best Movies According To Yash</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2> 
<HR />
<h3>Pirates Of The Caribbean</h3>
<p>The script is clever;<br /> Cinematography is fine;<br /> Special effects are spot-on.<br />Pirates Of The Caribbean Curse Of The Black Pearl is a terrific adventure film with action, drama, suspense, some romance, and humor.<br /> Johnny Depp is amazing as Captain Jack Sparrow and he's clearly having a lot of fun with this character.</p>
<H3>Fight Club</H3>
<p>"Fight Club" is the most frankly and cheerfully fascist big-star movie since "Death Wish," a celebration of violence in which the heroes write themselves a license to drink, smoke, screw and beat one another up.</p>
<h3>Whiplash</h3>
<p>What does it mean to be great? I loved Whiplash because Damien Chazelle highlights the blood, sweat and tears that come along with pure devotion to one’s craft; the hard work when nobody’s there to pat you on the shoulder. The final scene…wow.</p>
